	This project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to develop two innovative features aimed at improving communication and information dissemination at a college. The first feature involves the creation of an intelligent chatbot that caters to the specific needs of teachers and students. By processing natural language inputs, the chatbot provides information, addressing queries and offering relevant details based on user roles, thereby enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of communication within the academic environment.\\
	
	The second feature is a feedback system that automatically classifies feedback as either positive or negative, ensuring that the right content reaches the relevant audience. This system employs machine learning models to analyze the sentiment feedback and display the results to the appropriate members, enabling more informed and timely decisions. By integrating these AI-driven features, this project aims to improve user experience, streamline information flow, and enhance communication within the college ecosystem.\\
